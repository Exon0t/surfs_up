## Summary
June having a max of 85 and a min of 64. with the mean being closer to the max. washington post says that short sleeve weather would be 65 to 79 meaning for the month of june it would be a good time to sell ice cream. well in the months of december is a little spotty with the min being 56 with a a max of 83. Now with 56 degrees beeing fleece weather (again said by the washington psost) some days it will still be cold. Now the mean is closer to the max which means most of days will be high. I think for the month of December it should be open on the mid to hot day and closed on the cold.
