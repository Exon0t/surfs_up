## Summary
From look at thise data we can tell that in june it would def be possible to run the ice cream shop with the max being 83 and a min of 71 both rather high tempetures. December also has a hot day of 83 but a min of 56. the mean is just at 71 leaning closer to the max. I would say june def would be possible with some off days in december. But looking at the data it should have no problem running year round. espically the income it would be getting durring the summer
